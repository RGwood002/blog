# Project Overview
I had an idea that can basically be summed up as 3d printing as a service. My friend was kind enough to gift me their Prusa MK4S to allow me to continue
to use this device that they did not have a purpose for anymore. I hope to be able to offer them a remote way of accessing it and being able to utilize their own files for printing.
