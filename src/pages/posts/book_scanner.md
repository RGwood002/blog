# Project overview

Hardcover has offered an api that allows for users to manipulate their data in their own way

I decided I could create a seperate scanner to help scan in my library books and automatically scan in multiple books at once.

## Created with
The project contains the following:
- Jetson nano W/usb camera
- Docker
- Django

## How it was made
I had a project back in college that had a very similar idea, however I didn't get to work on the camera side. This project allowed me to focus on the camera end.
