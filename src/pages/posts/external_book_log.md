# Project Overview
Every now and then I lend a book to a friend that I know they would enjoy, 
however maybe a few months pass and I forget about this exchange. 

I then will suggest the book to another friend and want to lend them said book but forget where I sent it off to. 

So I wanted to create a simple way for people to externally "check-in" they have a book of mine. 
The approach was to simply have a QR code taped into a book to allow for anyone with said book to essetially "confirm" they are the current reader of the book.

#### Process Flow
Kicks off with me suggesting a book to a friend and offering to mail it to them. From there I can log into the admin panel for the app.
